A wide range of topics facinate me. Here are a few that I am currently working on. <br>

# Can Invertebrates Feel Pain?
Humans have long thought that pain is an experience exclusive to us. Recently, however, we have realised that other animals such as non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans respond to noxious stimuli in a way that is consistent with the idea of suffering and pain. The issue is that insects compose over 75% of all named species in the world yet it remains unknown if these animals are capable of suffering like all other tested animal groups.

# Biomechanics of Jumping Insects
You might think that a jump is an easy thing to do, but it is actually quite difficult task for an insect that is a thousand times smaller than we are. I am fascinated as to how, despite being so challenging, insects jump frequently as they explore their world, catch prey, and escape predators. My findings were published in my

with a cool discovery being that one group of Australian ants that were said to be incapable of jumping for the last 100 years were actually capable of leaping 3â€“4 cm to  move about their environment effeciently.
