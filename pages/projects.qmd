I am fascinated by a wide range of topics. Here are a few that I am currently interested in or working on: <br>

# Invertebrate Pain
ramble

# Jumping Insects
You might think that jumping is easy, but when you are an insect that is hundreds of times smaller than you it is actually quite a difficult task to achieve. I am fascinated as to how, despite being so challenging, insects jump frequently as they explore their world, catch prey, and escape predators. My findings were published in my [Masters thesis](https://doi.org/10.25949/26793253.v1) and one cool discovery was that one group of Australian ants that were said to be incapable of jumping were actually capable of leaping 3â€“4 cm.
