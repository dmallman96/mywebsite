# About Me  
I'm Daniel, a PhD candidate from the University of Sydney, Australia. This website is a test to slowly build my academic profile. I created this in Jupyter using Joyce Robbins' template and guide (https://github.com/jtr13/website-template). <br>
Go give it a star and play around if you want to do something similar!
